Because you recently travelled from a country with high prevalence of COVID-19, there are high odds that you also have COVID, so testing is not recommended at this time. We recommend you stay home for 14 days and follow these [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/10Things.pdf). 

During these two weeks if you start to develop fever, cough, shortness of breath or sore throat, call your doctor. If you do not have a primary care provider, or your provider is at NYC Health + Hospitals, then call our Contact Center to speak with someone about whether you need to go to a hospital: 844-692-4692.
