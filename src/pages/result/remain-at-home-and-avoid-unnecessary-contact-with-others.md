## If you have mild symptoms, you do not necessarily need to be evaluated or tested for COVID-19.

Instead, you should remain at home and avoid unnecessary contact with others, as you would if you had the regular flu. If you must go into public places, wear a mask if you have one and remain at least 6 feet away from others to prevent the infection from spreading. You should also wash your hands regularly

If you have further questions, call your primary care provider. If you  do not have a primary care provider, or your provider is at NYC Health + Hospitals, then call 844-629-4692. If you must go into public spaces, wear a mask if you have one and remain at least 6 feet away from others to protect the infection from spreading.

Finally, remember that the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to those of many other infections, such as the cold and flu; just because you have symptoms of cough, fever,or shortness of breath it does not mean you ahve COVID-19.
