Because you had close exposure to someone with COVID-19, it is very likely that you also have COVID-19, so testing is not necessary. We recommend you stay home for 14 days and follow these [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/10Things.pdf). During these two weeks if you start to develop fever, cough, shortness of breath or sore throat, feel free to call our Contact Center to speak with someone about whether you need to go to a hospital: 844-692-4692.
