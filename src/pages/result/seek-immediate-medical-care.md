If necessary, call 911. Otherwise call your primary care provider. If you do not have a primary care provider, or your provier is at NYC Health + Hospitals, then call 844-692-4692. If you must go into public places, wear a mask if you have one and remain at least 6 feet away from others to protect the infection from spreading.
