## You do NOT need to seek medical attention for COVID-19 at this time.

* **Wash your hands** often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
* If soap and water are not readily available, **use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.** Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
* **Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth** with unwashed hands.
* **Avoid close contact** with people who are sick.
* **Practice social distancing,** such as not shaking hands when in public, and trying to stay at least 6 feet away from others, particularly those who are ill. **This is particularly true if you are 60 years of age or older or have a chronic medial condition** such as heart disease, diabetese, or lung disease. If you fall into one of these categories, you might avoid leaving the house unnecessarily, particularly for extended travel.
* **Keep track of updates and recommendations from your local health department.** If the virus begins to spread widely in your community, the local authorities may recommend further measures to protect against infection.
