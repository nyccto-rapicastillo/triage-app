Because you’re feeling sick, we want to help you get the care you need, regardless of whether it’s COVID-19 or not. If you have a doctor, call them to discuss when you should be seen. If your primary care provider is at NYC Health + Hospitals or if you do not have a primary care provider, then call NYC Health + Hospitals at 844-692-4692 to speak with a health provider about whether you need an appointment.
