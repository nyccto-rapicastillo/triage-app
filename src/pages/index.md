    body: >-
      COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's
      caused by a virus called coronavirus. To limit the spread of the virus and
      reduce the chance of catching it yourself, you should stay at home. This
      is especially true if you have either:


      • a high temperature – you feel hot to touch on your chest or back


      • a new, continuous cough – this means you've started coughing repeatedly


      Do not go to a doctor’s office, pharmacy or hospital. You can take our
      [online screener](https://beaver-triage.netlify.com/question/), which will
      put you in touch with a doctor if you need it.
